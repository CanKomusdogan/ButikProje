# My First Freelance Job
## That never made it to production because of the carelessness of the employers...

This is a **fully functional** boutique e-shop with an admin panel.\
It was never actually used because the employers didn't care enough to open a corporate Virtual POS account.

Thankfully, **I was paid** and got what I deserved for my work even though they never used it.

## So, what is this e-shop capable of?
### The Admin Side:
- Changing the main page title and subtitles
- Managing orders
- Getting real-time push notifications when an order is submitted
- Managing users
- Managing the shop items. Adding, deleting, editing etc.
- Managing categories.
- Turning the user side off for maintenance etc.
### The User Side:
- TL;DR can be used like any other shop
- Adding items to cart
- Ordering the items in the cart
- Paying with Iyzico Virtual POS (sandbox api)
- Orders Page
- Categories
- Search

> [!CAUTION]
> ### Some issues that i would like to be honest about
> - The code files are big
> - I didn't finish the clothing sizes options and don't intend to since i used old technologies here and don't want to come back to this
> 1. Speaking of which, the tech stack here is not that great
>    - ASP.NET MVC5 which is not a modern option
>    - No Js framework, mostly vanilla and JQuery when needed
>    - Bootstrap, even though it is the latest version it could still be better in my opinion
> - MPA Design
> - The embarrasing mistake of using turkish table names in the SQL (which affected the entity names in Entity Framework :( ) I was way too lazy to fix this lol
> - No error pages

## Overall
This was my first serious project and I still consider this impressive for a first job and for someone who is still in high school.\
I am currently developing other projects at my internship with much better tech stacks and decisions :)
